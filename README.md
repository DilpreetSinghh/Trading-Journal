# Trading-Journal
## Theme - Financial Inclusion 

Amar and I am a trader myself. We have a very good idea what a new or even expert trader have issue while work.

First one the remembering the trading decision while on desk (trading hours)
and finding the reasoning of why we lose that trade.


Writing on journal (Physical notebook) isn't efficient. I will give you an example:
you are Intraday trader, You studied a few article regarding market situation as well as watch and analyse chart patterns. you can't write that down.

If you think, I can have screenshot and later I can refer from it, then good luck!

Trading Journal's goals is to combine the screenshot, links entry and exit estimates before trade and get details after trade. although you will get profit and loss analyse from trader. but here now you can read every single step you took before taking your trade.

## Requirements to run Coding file
Mac OS Sonoma 14.0
Simulator: iOS 17 or iPhone 17.0
Xcode 15.0

## Structures

### `CashDerivativeData`

Represents a single trade entry with details about the trade.

- Properties:
  - `id`: A unique identifier for the entry.
  - `selectedDate`: The date of the trade.
  - `selectedTime`: The time of the trade.
  - `CDSymbol`: The trading symbol.
  - `CDB_TradingType`: The type of trade before the plan.
  - `CDI_TradingType`: The type of trade after the plan.
  - `CDB_BuyPrice`: The buying price before the plan.
  - `CDI_BuyPrice`: The buying price after the plan.
  - `CDB_SellPrice`: The selling price before the plan.
  - `CDI_SellPrice`: The selling price after the plan.
  - `CDB_StopLoss`: The stop loss before the plan.
  - `CDI_StopLoss`: The stop loss after the plan.
  - `CDB_Qty`: The quantity before the plan.
  - `CDI_Qty`: The quantity after the plan.
  - `CDB_NetProfit`: The net profit before the plan.
  - `CDI_NetProfit`: The net profit after the plan.
  - `notes`: Any additional notes for the trade.

### `CashDerivative`

A SwiftUI view that allows users to input and save their trade details.

- Functions:
  - `saveData()`: Saves the current state of `cashDerivativeData` to `UserDefaults`.
  - `loadSavedNotes()`: Loads saved trade entries from `UserDefaults`.

## Views

### `CDSavedNotes`

A SwiftUI view that displays a list of saved trade entries.

- Functions:
  - `loadSavedNotes()`: Retrieves and decodes a list of `CashDerivativeData` from `UserDefaults`.
  - `saveNewNote()`: Encodes and saves a new `CashDerivativeData` to `UserDefaults`.

## Persistence

The app uses `UserDefaults` to persist trade entries. Each `CashDerivativeData` instance is encoded to JSON and stored with a specific key. The entries can be retrieved and decoded back into `CashDerivativeData` instances.

## Error Handling

Error handling is implemented using `do-catch` blocks around JSON encoding and decoding processes. Any errors encountered will be printed to the console.

## Usage

Users interact with the `CashDerivative` view to enter new trade details. Upon saving, the data is persisted to `UserDefaults`. Users can navigate to the `CDSavedNotes` view to see a list of their saved entries.

This is a general template for documentation. Depending on the complexity of your app and the audience for your documentation (developers, users, stakeholders), you might need to add more details, such as code snippets, usage examples, screenshots, and explanations of the underlying logic.

Remember, good documentation should be clear, concise, and informative, making it easy for others to understand and work with your code. If you need documentation for specific parts of your code or a more detailed explanation, please let me know!
