# Trading-Journal

### Introduction

Amar and I am a trader myself. We have a very good idea what a new or even expert trader have issue while work.

First one the remembering the trading decision while on desk (trading hours)
and finding the reasoning of why we lose that trade.


Writing on journal (Physical notebook) isn't efficient. I will give you an example:
you are Intraday trader, You studied a few article regarding market situation as well as watch and analyse chart patterns. you can't write that down.

If you think, I can have screenshot and later I can refer from it, then good luck!

Trading Journal's goals is to combine the screenshot, links entry and exit estimates before trade and get details after trade. although you will get profit and loss analyse from trader. but here now you can read every single step you took before taking your trade.
